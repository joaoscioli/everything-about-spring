# Spring Boot REST API

This project is a **foundational Spring Boot REST API** created as part of the  
**Everything About Spring Framework** series by *The Coding Cabin*.

Its purpose is to demonstrate how a real Spring Boot application starts:
with clear decisions, minimal dependencies, and a clean architectural baseline.

## 🎯 Project Purpose

This project aims to:

- Serve as a reference Spring Boot REST API
- Demonstrate standard architectural layering
- Focus on clarity over complexity
- Act as a starting point for more advanced Spring projects

This is **not** a feature-complete application — it is a **learning and foundation project**.
