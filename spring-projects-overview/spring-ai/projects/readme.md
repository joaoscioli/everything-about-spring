# Projects

This directory contains practical projects designed to demonstrate concepts from the Spring Framework ecosystem.

The goal is to move from theory to practice, evolving from fundamental Spring Core concepts to advanced architectural patterns and distributed systems.

Each project builds on previous knowledge and increases in complexity.

---

# Project Structure Philosophy

The projects are organized progressively:

- Level 1 — Core concepts
- Level 2 — Web & Boot fundamentals
- Level 3 — Architecture patterns
- Level 4 — Advanced & Enterprise scenarios

This progression allows developers to:

- Understand Spring internals
- Build real APIs
- Apply architectural principles
- Explore distributed systems concepts

---

# Level 1 — Spring Core Fundamentals

## 01-ioc-container-demo

Focus:
- ApplicationContext
- Bean lifecycle
- @Component
- @Configuration
- @Bean
- Dependency Injection

Goal:
Understand how the Spring IoC container works internally.

This project does NOT use Spring Boot.

---

## 02-aop-demo

Focus:
- Aspect-Oriented Programming
- @Aspect
- @Before / @After / @Around
- Proxy mechanism

Goal:
Understand how Spring implements cross-cutting concerns.

---

# Level 2 — Spring Boot & REST APIs

## 03-rest-api-basic

Focus:
- Spring Boot
- REST controllers
- Validation
- Exception handling
- HTTP concepts

Goal:
Create a simple RESTful API using Spring Boot.

---

## 04-rest-api-with-jpa

Focus:
- Spring Data JPA
- Repository pattern
- Transactions
- Database integration

Goal:
Build a real API connected to a relational database.

---

## 05-security-jwt

Focus:
- Spring Security
- Authentication
- Authorization
- JWT
- Role-based access control

Goal:
Secure a REST API using stateless authentication.

---

# Level 3 — Architecture Patterns

## 06-clean-architecture

Focus:
- Domain layer separation
- Use cases
- DTO mapping
- Dependency inversion

Goal:
Apply Clean Architecture principles using Spring.

---

## 07-hexagonal-architecture

Focus:
- Ports and adapters
- Domain isolation
- Infrastructure adapters

Goal:
Demonstrate Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters) with Spring.

---

# Level 4 — Advanced & Enterprise

## 08-microservice

Focus:
- Service isolation
- Docker
- Configuration management
- Health checks

Goal:
Build a production-ready microservice.

---

## 09-event-driven

Focus:
- Event publishing
- Asynchronous processing
- Messaging systems

Goal:
Demonstrate event-driven architecture using Spring.

---

## 10-observability-demo

Focus:
- Actuator
- Metrics
- Logging
- Monitoring concepts

Goal:
Understand how to monitor and observe Spring applications.

# How to Use These Projects

You can:

- Study them sequentially
- Use them as templates
- Extend them with new features
- Refactor them to test architectural approaches

Each project is intentionally minimal but structured according to best practices.

---

# Philosophy

These projects are not just "examples".

They are:

- Educational blueprints
- Architectural references
- Practical reinforcement of concepts

Spring is best learned by building.

This directory exists to make that process structured and intentional.
