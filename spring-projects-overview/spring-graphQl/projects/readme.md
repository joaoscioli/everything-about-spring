# Projects

This folder contains practical Spring-based projects designed to demonstrate concepts ranging from fundamentals to advanced architectural patterns.

The goal of these projects is to provide:

- Real-world examples
- Hands-on architecture
- Production-ready patterns
- Incremental complexity
- Practical Spring usage

Each project focuses on a specific area of the Spring ecosystem.

- REST controller
- Configuration via `application.yml`
- Spring Boot Actuator
- Dependency Injection basics

Purpose:
Understand the minimum viable Spring Boot application.

---

## 2. rest-api-crud

A complete REST API demonstrating:

- CRUD operations
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JPA
- H2 database
- Bean validation
- Global exception handling
- DTO pattern

Purpose:
Understand how to build a production-ready REST API.

---

# Level 2 — Intermediate

## 3. auth-api

Authentication and authorization service using:

- Spring Security
- JWT
- Role-based authorization
- Password encryption
- Custom security filters

Purpose:
Learn how to secure Spring applications properly.

---

## 4. hexagonal-architecture

Demonstrates:

- Clean Architecture
- Ports and Adapters
- Domain isolation
- Dependency inversion
- Repository abstraction
- Unit testing the domain layer

Purpose:
Understand how to structure maintainable systems.

---

## 5. event-driven-app

Demonstrates:

- Application events
- @EventListener
- Asynchronous execution
- Event-based decoupling

- Resilience4j
- Configuration management

Purpose:
Understand microservices architecture basics using Spring.

---

## 7. modular-monolith

Demonstrates:

- Modular structure

Purpose:
Build scalable systems without premature distribution.

---

## 8. observability-demo

Demonstrates:

- Spring Boot Actuator
- Micrometer metrics
- Prometheus integration
- Structured logging
- Health checks

Purpose:
Learn production observability practices.

---

## 9. spring-batch-job

Demonstrates:

- Spring Batch
- Scheduled jobs
- Data processing pipelines
- Retry and fault tolerance

Purpose:
Handle large-scale data processing tasks.

---

## 10. reactive-api

Demonstrates:

- Spring WebFlux
- Reactive programming model
- Mono and Flux
- R2DBC
- Non-blocking I/O

Purpose:
Understand reactive systems with Spring.

---

# How to Use These Projects

You can:

- Study them sequentially
- Use them as architectural references
- Run them locally
- Extend them
- Refactor them
- Use them as templates for real-world systems

---

# Suggested Learning Path

1. Start with `hello-spring`
2. Move to `rest-api-crud`
3. Study `auth-api`
4. Explore `hexagonal-architecture`
5. Choose advanced topics based on your interest

---

# Final Notes

These projects are not toy examples.

They are designed to demonstrate:

- Real architecture decisions
- Practical patterns
- Clean code principles
- Maintainability
- Scalability
- Production readiness

Spring is best learned by building.

This module exists for that purpose.
