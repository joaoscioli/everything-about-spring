# Projects -- Spring Practice Modules

## Introduction

This directory contains practical projects designed to reinforce the
concepts presented in the main documentation of this repository.

The goal is not only to demonstrate annotation usage, but to:

-   Apply solid architectural practices
-   Explore different application styles
-   Demonstrate common pitfalls and proper solutions
-   Progress from basic to advanced levels
-   Serve as a technical laboratory and professional portfolio

Each project is isolated, self-contained, and focused on a specific set
of concepts.

# How to Use This Directory

You can:

-   Study progressively (from beginner to advanced)
-   Analyze architectural decisions
-   Use it as an experimentation lab
-   Adapt it for professional portfolio purposes

Recommended study order:

01 → 02 → 03 → 04 → 05 → 06 → 07 → 08 → 09

# Capstone Project

## 09-ecommerce-system

A complete system integrating:

-   REST APIs
-   Security
-   Persistence
-   Events
-   Caching
-   Testing
-   Observability

Objective: consolidate all concepts into a cohesive, production-style
system.

# Final Notes

These projects are meant to evolve.

You are encouraged to:

-   Refactor them
-   Introduce improvements
-   Experiment with alternative architectures
-   Add observability and performance tuning
-   Integrate CI/CD pipelines

Architecture matters more than annotations. Practice builds mastery.
